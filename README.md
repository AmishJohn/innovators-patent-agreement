## Innovators Patent Agreement

The [Innovators Patent Agreement](https://github.com/twitter/innovators-patent-agreement/blob/master/innovators-patent-agreement.md) (IPA) is a new way to do patent assignment that keeps control in the hands of engineers. 
It is a commitment from a company to the engineers that patents can only be used for defensive purposesâ€“that is, 
only in response to a litigation threat against the company or a recent history of offensive patent use. 
The company will not use the patents in offensive litigation without the permission of the inventors.
